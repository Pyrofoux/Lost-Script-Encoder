A simple web tool to encode text to Lost Script, a cypher designed by Wildbow.

You need to enter:
- The text you want to encode
- The letters you have unlocked
- The different letter groups (for eg. A, B and C are in the same group. S, F and X are in the same group)

TODO:
- Add support for punctuation. A question is marked with the first word being crossed.
- Add support for translating common words into their glyphs format.
